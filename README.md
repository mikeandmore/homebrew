Homebrew
========
Features and usage of the Mac OS X version are [summarized on the homepage][homepage].

This is an experimental Solaris fork of [Homebrew][homepage].

Quick Install to /usr/local
---------------------------
Installation is slightly more tricky on Solaris. So there is no quick installer
at the moment. Currently there are a few dependencies you'll need to get first.

	These are on sunfreeware.com and install in /usr/local
    [GCC][gcc]
    [Curl][curl]
    [Ruby][ruby]


Dude! Just give me a one-liner!
-------------------------------
Okay then, but please note this installs Homebrew as root and
[we recommend against that][sudo].

    curl -LsSf http://github.com/rmyers/homebrew/tarball/master | sudo /usr/bin/tar xvz -C/usr/local --strip 1


But what packages are available?
--------------------------------
Before installing you can
[browse the Formula folder on GitHub][browse-formulae].

After installing, you can use `brew search` to find packages or `brew server`
to browse packages off of a local web server.

Warning not all the formula has been tested on Solaris, but we're working on that.
